# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# _________________________________ START HERE _____________________________________________________
Above is the default README.md file that comes with the create-react-app command. I have left it here for reference.

We'll be generally following this tutorial to learn more about the workings of react: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dorf8i6lCuk

To get this project up and running, you will need to have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once you have Node.js installed, you can open up your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store this project. Once you are in the correct directory, you can run the following command:yarn create react-app my-app (or npm create react-app my-app)

To start a fresh project delete files from the /src folder leaving App.js, index.css, and index.js and templated code.

!!!!!!!!!!! If your localhost server is not rendering check the index.js import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client"; and drop the /client portion. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not sure why this happens...
